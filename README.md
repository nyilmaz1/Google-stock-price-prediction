# Google-stock-price-prediction  
 Udemy: deep learning A-Z  
This RNN model has 5 years of google stock prices and tries to predict the January 2017 google stock prices. 
The model is trained on only the past 5 years, not on January prices.  
At the end, the predicted results and the actual results for January 2017 is compared. 
The goal of this model is to predict the trends (upward or downward) of the google stock price, instead of prediction the price itself.   
The plot at the end of the notebook shows that this model was succesful to capture the trends
